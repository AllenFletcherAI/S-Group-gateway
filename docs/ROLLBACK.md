# Rollback & Safety Net

> Confidence to make changes comes from knowing exactly how to reverse them (Habit 09).
> Always know the last known good commit before starting risky work.

   git push origin main
   ```
2. **Database Downward Migration:**
   - Run migration down-step if database schema was altered.
   - Verify table structure matches previous schema version.
3. **Feature Flag Disablement:**
   - If feature is behind a flag, disable flag in remote config to immediately cut off traffic without deploying.
4. **Smoke Test Customer Path:**
   - Execute the verification check in docs/TESTING.md to confirm service recovery.
